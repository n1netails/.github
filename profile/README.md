## 🚨 What Is N1netails?

N1netails is an open-source platform that provides **practical, developer-first alerting and monitoring** for modern applications.

If you’re tired of:

* Bloated SIEM solutions
* Complex enterprise monitoring tools
* Applications with *no* built-in alerting

…then N1netails gives you a **simple, powerful, and flexible** alternative.

It’s designed to be easy to integrate, easy to self-host, and easy to extend across services, languages, and environments.
